## What is MVC?

MVC stands for Model-View-Controller, a popular design pattern used for building web applications. It separates the application into three main components:

- **Model:** Represents the data. In this app, models define products, categories, and companies.
- **View:** The UI layer that displays data to users and collects input. This app uses Razor views to render HTML pages.
- **Controller:** Handles user requests, interacts with the model, and returns views. Controllers manage the flow between the model and the view.
